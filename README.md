# labSchedule
OK Lab schedule json

This file is not in use at the moment. The code4ka (ok-lab-karlsruhe.de) uses the schedule file at 
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CodeforKarlsruhe/labSchedule/master/karlsruhe.json


The new codefor germany site should use that one as well, or we provide the final version here and update code4ka. TBD
